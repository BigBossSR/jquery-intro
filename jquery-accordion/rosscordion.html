Nothing's ever fulfilled, not until the very end. And closure. Nothing is ever over. Drag on Camel.</div>

You know that their sensory experience constituted a unique individual with purpose and meaning. So certain that they were more than biological puppet. The truth wills out, and everybody sees.
